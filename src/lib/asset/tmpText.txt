Okay, hold on, don't shoot. 

worry
Now, let's worry about how you get there. 
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda... 
Don't worry about that.
Wait a second. Let me ask you something.
Don't worry. 
Don't worry, Bruce.

Gotta move on. 
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

Gotta move your foot here.

Point your toe this way. 
You made your point. Just sit down, okay? 
Okay. No, no, here's my point. You know what? 
All right, all right. That's a good point. That's a good point. 
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time... 
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time? 
I'm gonna be running point on the scepter. 
I mean, what was the point? I was too late. 
She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. 
No, that's my point.

Ready? Three fingers. 
All right. I'm not ready for this. 
All right, the glove's ready. 
You ready, Cap? 

fingers
Ready? Three fingers. 
When Thanos snapped his fingers... 
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back. 
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

Nice! 
Nice throw, kiddo. 
Would be nice. 
Nice place in the Village, though. 
A girl would be nice. 
This is nice.

Nate, mayo or mustard? 

both
Or both? 
I think we both need to get a life. 
Best of both worlds. 
When were they both there? 
Then I guess we both know who it's got to be. 
Then you got 'em both the second time. 
They both do. 

puts
Who puts mayo on a hot dog? 

probably
Probably your brothers. 
I should probably lie down for a minute. Go rest my eyes. 
He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day. 
It's probably a rival gang. 
They're probably just happy to have a home. 
Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle. 
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting...

Probably your brothers.

If you could send Loki some soup.
Yes, milady.

coming
We're coming. We're hungry. 
I saw this coming a few years back. 
You know, I saw a pod of whales when I was coming over the bridge. 
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home. 
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. Anything else. 
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it. 
and it doesn't work, you're not coming back. 
She's not coming back. 
Hang on! I'm coming!

That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. 
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... 
never even had a chance to get their guns off. 
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back... 
But this is a second chance. 
I got my second chance right here, Cap. 
There might be a chance we could fix everything. 
A chance, maybe. 
Today, we have a chance to take it all back. 
And you'll have the chance to prove it. 
Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me. 

win
That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. 
I see this as an absolute win. 
and we're gonna win. 
You win. 
You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah?

The parts that are still working... 
Look, he's still got the stones, so... 
I'm still trying to be better. 
I'm still worthy. 
But she still isn't here, is she? 
Just so you know, this is my ship still. 

hope
Oh, God, I hope so. 
Hope? 
Hope. She's my... 
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes. 
Don't give me hope. 
I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back.

Only a tiny bit sadistic. 
Good, because if we blow the grid, I don't want to lose Tiny here in the 1950s.

Only a tiny bit sadistic. 
Bit of lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are...? 
That's a little bit harsh.

Everybody knows who's in charge.

I'm hoping if you play this back... 

pull
but I got to say I was really hoping to pull off one last one. 
She was supposed to pull me out. 
And now you wanna pull a... What do you call it? 
And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf. 
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying, jurisdiction... 
Get your hands off me.
Window's closing. Pull my pin.
Shake that, don't pull it. 
This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow...

but I got to say I was really hoping to pull off one last one. 
what he's been doing for the last few years... 
So, I'd like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night. 
For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing. 
Don't change anything from the last five years. 
down to its last atom. 

looks
But it looks like... 
Well, you know what it looks like. 
are trying to take a census and it looks like he did... 
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys... 
Looks like we're improvising. 

mean
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks... 
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try. 
I mean, the scene that he left... 
Yeah, but, I mean, what are we gonna do? 
That doesn't mean we should know what to expect. 
I mean, they look like bad guys. 
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down? 
I mean, what was the point? I was too late. 
But that doesn't mean you're useless. 
I'm starting to think we mean different people here, Natasha. 
let alone to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised... 

actually
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks... 
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her. 
Yeah, we don't actually say that name in here. 
So, Jane, actually... 
That, actually. 
Well, actually Hydra, but we didn't know that yet. 
Clearly you weren't actually born here, right? 
Are you telling me this actually worked? 

grovel
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks... 

couple
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks... 
I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups. 

weeks
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks... 
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. 
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago... 
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now?

He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day. 
But would you be able to rest? 
You can rest now. 

eyes
I should probably lie down for a minute. Go rest my eyes. 
Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. 
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor. 
I see with more than eyes, you know that.

So, what's up? You just here for a hang, or what? 
Hang on! I'm coming! 
Hang on. I got you, kid. 

lost
I lost the kid. 
Tony, we lost. 
We lost. 
But I lost someone very important to me. 
'cause I lost twice. 
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost... 
and then, we all lost. 
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes. 
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people. 
Five years ago, we lost. 
We lost friends. 
We lost family. 
We lost a part of ourselves. 
You think you're the only one who lost people? 
I lost the only family I ever had. 
that knows not what it has lost... 
I thought I lost you. 

kid
I lost the kid. 
Kid! 
Hey, kid! 
I get it. I don't want it, either.
But come on. The kid...
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again. 
When your kid was born, were you nervous? 
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. 
Hang on. I got you, kid.

It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth. 
Until two days ago... 
You used them two days ago! 
You used them two days ago! 

thanos
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth. 
Thanos wiped out... 
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. 
To kill Thanos. 
I can tell you where Thanos is. 
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. 
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan. 
When Thanos snapped his fingers... 
Thanos is there. 
Thanos should've killed all of us. 
Thanos... 
And then Thanos happened... 
Like before Thanos.
Wait.
Like Thanos. 
Korg, why don't you tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off? 
They got Thanos. 
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos? 
First of all, that's horrible.
It's Thanos.
Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... 
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved. 
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir. 
It's where Thanos murdered my sister. 
Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos. 
Thanos knows. 
Thanos... 
Thanos finds the Soul Stone. 
Thanos left here with the stone... 
You saw what those stones did to Thanos. 
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago... 
No way to get 'em back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel. 

came
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth. 
We need to get 'em back where they came from. 

earth
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth. 
Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. 
The things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere. 
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal. 

world
World governments are in pieces. 
Alive and otherwise, that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world. 
The world is in our hands. 
our world would be overrun. 
God, what a world. Universe, now. 
is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.

World governments are in pieces.

Can you bring him back?
I'm working on it.
We're working on that right now. 
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working? 

trying
are trying to take a census and it looks like he did... 
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. 
I'm still trying to be better. 
trying to get you to stop... 
And maybe not die trying. 
They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. 
They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs. 
They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit has been stopped by lightning strikes. 
For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing. 
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot. 
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service and assisting. 
I'm trying.
Get him the hell back.
Hey, I said I'm trying.
Sam.

take
are trying to take a census and it looks like he did... 
Here, take this. 
You guys take care of him... 
And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we got to take... 
We have to take a stand. 
No, he wants you to take a picture with him.
I don't want a picture.
No, you feel bad.
Take the goddamn phone.
That'll take a second.
Just a moment.
Please take your hand off me. 
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal. 
And so I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from... 
I'll take you to space. 
Today, we have a chance to take it all back. 
Take care, okay?
Yeah.
Let's take cover. 
Let's take cover. 
We can take that off your hands. 
Take the stairs. 
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs. 
In order to take the stone... 
Take it off! Take it off! 
How long is this gonna take? 

census
are trying to take a census and it looks like he did... 

exactly
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do. 
Juice pops exactly... 
Exactly. 
Not exactly. 
Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me. 
Everything is gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. 

wiped
Thanos wiped out... 
No, he wiped my face with a planet... 

living
50% of all living creatures.

He just opened a portal and walked through. 
comes through me. 
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up... 
pushing time through Lang. 
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now? 
I don't know how you're gonna get it through all of that. 

wrong
What's wrong with him? 
He's not wrong. 
What's wrong with your eye? 
So, did something go wrong or did something go right? 

pissed
He's pissed.

but there's a lot of that going around, ain't there? 

honestly
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear. 
I'm honestly happy to see you guys, I just... 
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. 
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down? 

exact
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear. 
They were there at a time... I have a vaguely exact idea. 
you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got 'em... 

second
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear. 
But this is a second chance. 
I got my second chance right here, Cap. 
That'll take a second.
Just a moment.
What is this?
Hold on a second.
Don't worry about that.
Wait a second. Let me ask you something.
Sometimes it takes a second. 
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time." 
Then you got 'em both the second time. 

thought
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear. 
Thought I was dreaming. 
I thought you were coordinating search and rescue. 
I'm confused. I thought that was your job. 
I thought about what my dad did. 
I thought my dad was tough on me. 
I thought by eliminating half of life... 
I thought I lost you. 
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... 
Well, after I put the stones back, I thought... 

build
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear. 

bear
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear. 

maybe
Maybe I am. 
Maybe it doesn't need to be done. 
And maybe not die trying. 
A chance, maybe. 
Maybe smash a few things along the way. 
Maybe he made a mistake. 
Maybe he's making this shit up. 
Maybe you should. 
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? 
Maybe 10 minutes. 
Maybe this time. 
It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge. 
maybe... 

hunting
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.

Deep space scans...

Deep space scans... 

satellites
and satellites, and we got nothing. 
No satellites. No ships. No armies. 

nothing
and satellites, and we got nothing. 
Bunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap. 
I used to have nothing. 
so nothing sounds crazy anymore. 
Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that... 
did nothing for your ass. 
Nothing. 
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. 
It was six stones or nothing.
You're repeating yourself, you know that?
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. 
They suspected nothing. 
Absolutely nothing. 

fought
Tony, you fought him. 

told
Who told you that? 
Mommy told me to come and save you. 
Well, that's what I heard.
Wait, but who? Who told you that?
If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone... 

fight
I didn't fight him. 
That's what happened. There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable. 
We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight, too. 
This is the fight of our lives... 
You should fight one another for the honor of leadership. 

face
No, he wiped my face with a planet... 
Listen, fur face. 
Good. That face goes there. 
Why the long face? 
when I got hit in the face with the broadsword? 

planet
No, he wiped my face with a planet... 
on this planet. 
Half the planet didn't. 
Is that a person?
No, Morag's a planet.
Like a planet? Like in outer space? 
On a planet called Morag. 
what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet... 
And something like a normal version of the planet has been restored.

Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago... 
Get those stones as far away as possible! 

store
while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store. 

happened
That's what happened. There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable. 
What the hell happened here? 
And then Thanos happened... 
What happened? 

cause
That's what happened. There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable. 
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't. 
Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that would be horseshit. 
'cause I lost twice. 
'Cause I've got some important shit going on here! 
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks. 
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name? 

beatable
That's what happened. There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable. 

any
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything? 
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before? 
No ground defenses of any kind. 
This is what we have. We're not making any more. 
Basically, any movie that deals with time travel. 
Are there any other options with the Tesseract? 
Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? 
Not that death at any time isn't untimely. 

clues
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything? 
no clues, no strategies, no options. 

coordinates
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything? 
I got no coordinates... 
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in. 

anything
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything? 
No one's ever seen anything like it. 
So, if anything goes sideways... 
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her. 
Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible? 
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. Anything else. 
We never did anything to you! 
I'll give you anything! 
Have you been listening to anything?
Guys.
Do you have anything with pants? 
Don't change anything from the last five years. 
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

You know, I saw a pod of whales when I was coming over the bridge. 
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. 
And I believe I remember telling all youse... 
I don't believe we would. 
I believe the most likely outcome will be our collective demise. 
You will not believe what's been going on.

Thought I was dreaming. 

focus
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus. 
Can we focus, please? 

needed
And I needed you. 
Alive and otherwise, that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world. 
That's what we needed. 

past
As in, past tense. 
The stones are in the past. We could go back, we could get them. 
All right? It means no talking to our past selves... 
Changing the past doesn't change the future. 
Think about it. If you travel to the past... 
that past becomes your future... 
and your former present becomes the past... 

tense
As in, past tense.

That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy.

I mean, what was the point? I was too late.

Buddy.

I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner. 
Scott, calm down.
Sorry.
Sorry, but I wasn't asking. 
Sorry, Cap. 
Bit of lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are...? 
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. 
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem. 
Steve? Sorry. 
Look, I'm sorry, no offense, but you're a very earthly being, okay? 
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity? 
I'm sorry. 

shave
You know what I need? I need a shave. 

remember
And I believe I remember telling all youse... 
Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not. 
I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too. 
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? 
Remember the Battle of Harokin... 
That'll be easy to remember.
Howard...
And now, looking back on it, I just remember the good stuff. 
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago... 
And as long as there are those that remember what was... 
Do you remember when we were in space? 
Remember... 

telling
And I believe I remember telling all youse... 
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on... 
Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe... 
to bring everyone back, and you're telling me that you won't even... 
Are you telling me this actually worked? 
I'm telling you. You're in no condition. 
I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.

freedoms

work
Well, that didn't work out, did it? 
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers." 
You know, we usually work as a team here... 
This is gonna work, Steve. 
But the work is done. 
And secondly, time doesn't work that way. 
I'm going to try something. Okay? I have no idea if it's going to work. 
I had no idea if that was gonna work. 
But we work with what we got, right? 
But the work is done. 
and it doesn't work, you're not coming back. 
Did it work?
We're not sure. It's okay.
Everything is gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. 
How'd that work out for ya? 

lose
I said we'd lose. 
Good, because if we blow the grid, I don't want to lose Tiny here in the 1950s. 
you must lose that which you love. 
You lose this again, I'm keeping it. 
Move it or lose it, hairbag. 

together
You said, "We'll do that together, too." 
I put the brains and the brawn together... 
Get it together! 
I literally pieced it together as I went along. 
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together. 
The Asgardians of the Galaxy back together again. 

guess
And guess what, Cap? 
Let me guess, he turned into a baby. 
I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again. 
Then I guess we both know who it's got to be. 
I guess we do. 

best
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers." 
Best of both worlds. 
Okay, I'll do my best. 
Strange is meant to be the best of us. 
He did his best. 
I'll do my best. 

fact
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers." 
I know for a fact they were there. 
Look, it's not just the fact... 
is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America. 

avengers
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers." 
We're the "Avengers," not the "Pre-vengers." 
Avengers. 
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together. 
Avengers...

We're the "Avengers," not the "Pre-vengers." 

vengers
We're the "Avengers," not the "Pre-vengers."

You made your point. Just sit down, okay? 
He made it for you. 
Maybe he made a mistake. 
I was made for this. 

sit
You made your point. Just sit down, okay? 
She's great by the way.
Tony, you're sick. Sit down.
Why don't you come sit down?
I'm not done yet.

great
She's great by the way.
Tony, you're sick. Sit down.
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan. 
That's great. 
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.
Great minds think alike. 
Great to see you, angry girl! 
It's ridiculous.
I think you look great, Cap.
Great.
What are we improvising?
and to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great. 

sick
She's great by the way.
Tony, you're sick. Sit down.
I am sick of this. 
and she became very, very sick. 

blood
We need you. You're new blood. 
Born out of blood. 

bunch
Bunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap. 
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys... 
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit? 
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps. 
or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities. 

tired
Bunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap. 

mules
Bunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap.

options
no clues, no strategies, no options. 
Are there any other options with the Tesseract? 
No, no, no, there's no other options.

Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

You trust me?

A liar is not one of them. 
A liar is not one of them. 

put
You find him, you put that on... 
I put the brains and the brawn together... 
I can put a pin in it right now and stop. 
I should put it in a lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake... 
We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet. 
Well, after I put the stones back, I thought... 

hide
you hide. 
had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves. 
where do you hide it? 

sedative
Bruce gave him a sedative.

You guys take care of him... 
Don't care. Couldn't care less. 
Take care, okay?
Yeah.
I don't much care. 

bring
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back. 
Use them to bring everyone back. 
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back. 
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back... 
to bring everyone back, and you're telling me that you won't even... 
let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. 
Can you bring him back?
I'm working on it.
He'll grow.
Bring Scott back.
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes. 
Didn't bring one for the whole team. 
I think we could bring them back. 
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back. 
You promise to bring that back in one piece, right? 
All right, bring it down, Blue. 
Bring her to my ship. 
Bring it up. 
I said bring them in. 
Cap, we can bring her back. Isn't that right? 
Look, sitting here staring at the thing is not gonna bring everybody back. 
Find the stones, bring them to me. 
Where did that bring you? 
When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back. 

xorrian
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back. 

elixir
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.

Let's kill him properly this time. 
Activate Instant Kill.

You know, we usually work as a team here...

We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight, too. 
It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

All right. We have a plan. 
Father's plan is finally in motion. 

disassembled
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. 

wanted
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. 
Dude. Come on!
No. You never wanted a time heist.
What? You wanted more? 

once
where would we go once his plan was complete? 
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end. 
We only see him once a month when he comes in for "supplies." 
Because once we're done with the stones... 

complete
where would we go once his plan was complete? 

answer
And his answer was always the same. 
Answer the question. 
No, he's going to answer to us. Odin can have what's left. 

same
And his answer was always the same. 
Same old crap. You know, how things have changed. 
And, you know, just so we're talking about the same thing... 
If it's all the same to you... 
No. The same Nebula... 

garden
"To the Garden." 
Military installation, Garden State. 

cute
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan. 

retirement
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.

And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. 
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago...

and she became very, very sick.

Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. 
No ground defenses of any kind. 

power
Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. 
When I say kill the power, kill the power. 
Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag. 
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it? 
Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship. 
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it? 
When you break into a place called "The Temple of the Power Stone"... 

surge
Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. 

ridiculously
Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke. 
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

seen
No one's ever seen anything like it. 
Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible? 
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him? 
Yeah, Doctor Zola. No, I haven't seen a soul. 
And you've never seen these two men before? 
You've seen what we become. 

used
He used the stones again. 
You used them two days ago! 
I used the stones to destroy the stones. 
I used to have nothing. 
My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale. 
You used them two days ago! 
I used the stones to destroy the stones. 

shorthanded
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know? 

em
So, let's get 'em. 
Tell my family I love 'em. 
You tell 'em yourself. 
Did we get 'em all? 
All I know is he doesn't have 'em. 
Then you got 'em both the second time. 
We need to get 'em back where they came from. 
No way to get 'em back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel. 
you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got 'em... 

use
Use them to bring everyone back. 
That's it. All right? We use that... 
I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives. 
Oh, yes! Please, use knives. 

small
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... 
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. 
You're small, but you're talking loud. 

undo
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... 
They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs. 

owe
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try. 

room
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try. 
Everybody in this room is about that superhero life. 
The Federales found a room full of bodies. 
Almost everyone in this room has had an encounter... 

end
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before? 
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end. 
with skeletons on the end of them and everything. 
Part of the journey is the end. 

differently
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before? 
time works differently in the quantum realm. 

than
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before? 
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right? 
Bigger than his? 
I see with more than eyes, you know that. 
rather than who I'm supposed to be. 

superhero
Everybody in this room is about that superhero life. 

asking
And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time? 
Sorry, but I wasn't asking. 

hell
And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time? 
What the hell? 
What the hell happened here? 
but I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about. 
Then why the hell did Strange give it away? 
What the hell is this? 
I'm trying.
Get him the hell back.

other
There are a lot of other planets in the universe. 
I went on a date the other day. 
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here? 
I think I liked you better either of the other ways. 
Look out for each other. 
You guys watch each other's six. 
Where is this other Nebula? 
Are there any other options with the Tesseract? 
No, no, no, there's no other options. 
For the other... 
the other half would thrive. 
See you on the other side, man. 

planets
There are a lot of other planets in the universe. 
On thousands of planets. 

universe
There are a lot of other planets in the universe. 
The universe required correction. 
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe. 
Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe... 
I will shred this universe... 
A grateful universe. 
God, what a world. Universe, now. 

unfortunately
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys. 

son
Let's go get this son of a bitch. 
No, son, you don't. 
Son of Edith. 

bitch
Let's go get this son of a bitch. 

hasn
Who here hasn't been to space? 
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it? 

ship
You better not throw up on my ship. 
There's beer on the ship. 
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship. 
Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship. 
Bring her to my ship. 
Just so you know, this is my ship still.

Approaching jump in three... 
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now. 

jump
Approaching jump in three... 
You did the hardest part. You took the jump. 

head
I'll head down for recon. 
I went for the head. 
I'm about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. 
Korg, why don't you tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off? 
My head is splitting. I don't know. 
Head to the lobby.
All right, I'll see you there.
His head was over there... 
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk. 
it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. 

recon
I'll head down for recon. 

steve
This is gonna work, Steve. 
You know what? Give me a break, Steve. 
Steve? Sorry. 

doesn
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't. 
I got to tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even wanna find him. 
Maybe it doesn't need to be done. 
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't. 
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda... 
This doesn't feel right. 
And secondly, time doesn't work that way. 
Changing the past doesn't change the future. 
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved. 
That doesn't mean we should know what to expect. 
That doesn't sound mild. 
and it doesn't work, you're not coming back. 
But that doesn't mean you're useless. 
All I know is he doesn't have 'em. 
But it doesn't always roll that way. 

ships
No satellites. No ships. No armies. 
In the Hudson?
There's fewer ships...

No satellites. No ships. No armies.

No ground defenses of any kind. 

kind
No ground defenses of any kind. 
For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease... 
What kind you want? 
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces and the magic hammers and whatnot. 
What kind? 
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he? 
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone... 
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it? 

question
Answer the question. 
Let me ask you a question. 
What are you doing?
Just asked him a question.
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

all gone. 
but she's gone. 
Really gone. 
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...

It nearly killed me. 
They almost killed him. 

done
But the work is done. 
What he's done here... 
Maybe it doesn't need to be done. 
You done? Yeah? 
You're done hurting people. 
Why don't you come sit down?
I'm not done yet.
Let's get it done.
Yes, sir.
Because once we're done with the stones... 
So, he must've done it for a reason. 
But the work is done. 
They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs. 
you've done for this country. 
Natasha, you know what I've done. 
Well done. 

inevitable
I am inevitable. 
I am inevitable. 
I am inevitable. 

tear
We have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying!

My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale. 
My father... 
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship. 
Father's plan is finally in motion. 
We will not fail you, Father. 
My father is many things. 
Yes, Father. 
Thank you, Father. 
Father... 

things
My father is many things. 
Same old crap. You know, how things have changed. 
And then things got quiet... 
The things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere. 
You can't say things like that. 
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here? 
I've got beer, tequila, all sorts of things. 
Yes, these things happen, though. You know? 
Maybe smash a few things along the way. 
Things look like they're just about wrapped up here. 
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go. 
My father is many things. 

daughter
Thank you, daughter. 
You got a wife, a daughter. 
Thank you, daughter.

Daughter of Ivan. 
without his daughter. 
Daughter.

went
I went for the head. 
I went on a date the other day. 
I went in the ice in '45, right after I met the love of my life. 
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.

I literally pieced it together as I went along.

So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight? 

first
It's the first time in five years. 
You first. 
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost... 
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people. 
First of all, that's horrible.
It's Thanos.
You missed the first time. 
For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path. 
Where to first? 

sitting
You know? I'm sitting there at dinner. 
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity? 
Look, sitting here staring at the thing is not gonna bring everybody back.

You know? I'm sitting there at dinner. 
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner... 
I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again. 

talk
I didn't even know what to talk about. 
What did you talk about? 
It's the front gate.
I really need to talk to you guys.
So, who do we talk to about this? 
If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch. 
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants... 
I really need to talk to you. 
We can talk. 
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. 
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? 
Go grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him. 
Talk to me, Banner.

Same old crap. You know, how things have changed.

Same old crap. You know, how things have changed.

You did the hardest part. You took the jump. 
I got to tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even wanna find him. 
That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. 
We lost a part of ourselves. 
Yes, but you're leaving out the most important part. 
This is the part where spikes come out... 
in the case of an untimely death. On my part. 
Part of the journey is the end.

You did the hardest part. You took the jump. 
You took everything from me.

And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we got to take... 
It's a baby. 
It's Scott.
As a baby.
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me. 
Let me guess, he turned into a baby. 
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos? 

steps
And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we got to take... 

become
to try and become whole again, try and find purpose. 
You know what I've become. 
we become friends. 
We become sisters. 
You've seen what we become. 

whole
to try and become whole again, try and find purpose. 
The whole time travel do-over? 
Didn't bring one for the whole team. 
We are getting the whole team, yeah? 

ice
I went in the ice in '45, right after I met the love of my life. 
You look like melted ice cream. 

met
I went in the ice in '45, right after I met the love of my life. 
We met a few years ago at the airport... 
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. 
Have we ever met that guy? 

woke
Woke up 70 years later. 
And I must've passed out, because I woke up and you were gone. 

later
Woke up 70 years later. 
We can all stand around posing up a storm later.

We can take that off your hands. 
Get your hands off me.
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

left
It's left to us, guys. 
I mean, the scene that he left... 
The ones that are left, anyway. 
You're drifting left. 
No, he's going to answer to us. Odin can have what's left. 
it never left. 
We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. 
Thanos left here with the stone... 
On your left. 

something
And we got to do something with it. 
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. Anything else. 
something to get rid of. 
No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind. 
Something tells me... 
Something died in here! 
We found something. 
Don't worry about that.
Wait a second. Let me ask you something.
I'm going to try something. Okay? I have no idea if it's going to work. 
Mom, I have to tell you something. 
They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. 
They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs. 
Just let me do something good. Something right. 
Tell me something. 
Something just entered the upper atmosphere. 
You got something for me? 
And something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. 
So, did something go wrong or did something go right? 

excuse
Excuse me. Sorry. 
Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
Yes.
Excuse me? 
Excuse me.

I thought my dad was tough on me. 
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers. 

big
You're so big! 
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on. 
We're gonna need a really big brain. 
Where's Big Green? 
Korg, why don't you tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off? 
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?

I believe the most likely outcome will be our collective demise. 

another
Not likely.
What? You gonna get another haircut?
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time? 
There's another consciousness... 
Another Nebula. 
There's another way to retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. 
You should fight one another for the honor of leadership. 
There shall be no knifing one another.

Not likely.
What? You gonna get another haircut?

Hi, hi! Is anyone home? 
Anyone else here kill that guy? 
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there? 
Is anyone else seeing this? 

making
anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... 
That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. 
This is what we have. We're not making any more. 
Maybe he's making this shit up.

anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't...

anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... 
You shouldn't have come. 
You shouldn't be here.

Tell me you found that Cube. 
I found them all.

I never had them.
Lila?
Never mind. These will be fine. Thank you. 
it never left. 
That's not me. It's not, I could never... 
I would never betray you. 
Never. Never. 
Dude. Come on!
No. You never wanted a time heist.
And you've never seen these two men before? 
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. 
The arrogant never do. 
They'll never know it. 
it was never personal. 

their
never even had a chance to get their guns off. 
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people. 
I don't judge people on their worst mistakes. 
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers? 

guns
never even had a chance to get their guns off. 

rival
It's probably a rival gang. 

gang
It's probably a rival gang. 

isn
Except it isn't. 
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back. 
I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. 
One stone isn't six, Nebula. 
Cap, we can bring her back. Isn't that right? 
But she still isn't here, is she? 
Not that death at any time isn't untimely. 
It isn't.

It's definitely Barton. 
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

It's definitely Barton. 
Barton! Barton, come in.

Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here? 
This is Rocket.
How ya doing?
Why are you doing this? 
What do you think we're doing here? 
What are you doing? 
Who's they? What are we doing?
And I know how I know.
What are you doing?
Just asked him a question.
What's he been doing? 
And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time. 
What are you doing? 
How you doing, squirt?

but you seem pretty miserable already. 

pretty
but you seem pretty miserable already. 
I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too. 
No, no. I'm pretty sure he's dead. 
He's pretty good at that. 
As promises go, that was pretty lame. 
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants... 

miserable
but you seem pretty miserable already. 

already
but you seem pretty miserable already. 
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right? 
Hey. Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already? 
They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs. 
No, they already have one.

One side there, Lebowski. 
See you on the other side, man.

I'm about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich.

I just got hit in the head with the Hulk. 
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

Force of habit. 

keep
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on... 
Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs. 
Will you keep that a little quiet? 
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock. 
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down? 
So, we keep it that way.

and grow. 
He'll grow.
Bring Scott back.
that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in. 

family
This family. 
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

Tell my family I love 'em. 
Do we know if she had family? 

think
I think we both need to get a life. 
Yeah, a time heist. Of course. Why didn't we think of this before? 
Why do you think? 
Great minds think alike. 
The kitchen, I think. 
I think I liked you better either of the other ways. 
Didn't think so. 
I think we could bring them back. 
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity... 
Think about it. If you travel to the past... 
I think it's gratuitous, but whatever. 
I think I'm having a panic attack. 
You think you're the only one who lost people? 
What do you think we're doing here? 
It's ridiculous.
I think you look great, Cap.
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached. 
I don't think so. 
I'm starting to think we mean different people here, Natasha. 
What, you think I wanna do it? 
And "can't" seems very definitive. Don't you think? 
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now? 
I think it worked. 
It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge. 
No, I don't think I will. 

hi
Hi, hi! Is anyone home? 
Hi. 
Hi. 
Hi, I'm Peter Parker. 
Hi, Sam. 

home
Hi, hi! Is anyone home? 
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home. 
They're probably just happy to have a home. 
bye-bye, you're not going home. 
then no one else is going home, either. 
Everybody comes home. 

scott
This is Scott Lang. 
Scott. 
Scott. 
It's crazy.
Scott.
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. 
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

Good luck, Scott. You got this. 
Hold on.
Is that Scott?
Yes, it's Scott. 
It's Scott.
As a baby.
He'll grow.
Bring Scott back.
Scott, calm down.
Sorry.
Scott, get this back to the compound. 
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working? 

lang
This is Scott Lang. 
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up... 
pushing time through Lang. 
Do it, Lang! 

airport
We met a few years ago at the airport... 

germany
in Germany? 

mask
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on. 

wouldn
You wouldn't recognize me.
Is this an old message?
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. 
let alone to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised... 

recognize
You wouldn't recognize me.
Is this an old message?

message
You wouldn't recognize me.
Is this an old message?

ant
Ant-Man? I know you know that. 
Did you want to grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man. 
They're Hulk fans. They don't know Ant-Man. 

man
Ant-Man? I know you know that. 
Did you want to grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man. 
They're Hulk fans. They don't know Ant-Man. 
What's up, Regular-Sized Man? 
You heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green. 
He's the man above the folks behind Nick Fury. 
Now you go and be the man you're meant to be. 
Hey, man! Make love, not war. 
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

I miss her, man. 
You're a good man, Sam.

I really need to talk to you guys.
Shut the front door. 
What you seek lies in front of you.

It's the front gate.
I really need to talk to you guys.

either
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? 
I get it. I don't want it, either.
But come on. The kid...
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. 
I think I liked you better either of the other ways. 
Me either. 
then no one else is going home, either. 

studied
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? 

quantum
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? 
I was in a place called the quantum realm. 
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe. 
See, the rules of the quantum realm aren't like they are up here. 
time works differently in the quantum realm. 
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time... 
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time? 
Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale... 
That's not how quantum physics works. 
Time After Time.
Quantum Leap.
No way to get 'em back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel. 
Going quantum. Three... 

physics
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? 
That's not how quantum physics works. 

make
Only to make conversation. 
Make sense? 
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

conversation
Only to make conversation. 

called
I was in a place called the quantum realm. 
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again. 
Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead. 
Someone called it a stone before. 
On a planet called Morag. 
When you break into a place called "The Temple of the Power Stone"... 
That would be the number that you called, yes. 

realm
I was in a place called the quantum realm. 
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe. 
See, the rules of the quantum realm aren't like they are up here. 
time works differently in the quantum realm. 
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time... 
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time? 

own
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe. 
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back. 
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity... 
If I give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I'm dooming my own. 
we can return each one to its own timeline... 
Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interest. 
You could not live with your own failure. 
Quail, that's your own insecurities in there. 

microscopic
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe. 

incredibly
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. 

supposed
She was supposed to pull me out. 
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it? 
I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I? 
Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor. 
It was supposed to be me. 
Everything is gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. 
rather than who I'm supposed to be. 

stuck
and I got stuck in there. 
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... 
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... 

rules
See, the rules of the quantum realm aren't like they are up here. 
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. 

aren
See, the rules of the quantum realm aren't like they are up here. 
but I'm fine, okay. We're fine, aren't we? 
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so... 
Hey. Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already? 
You're here, aren't you? 
and to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great. 

everything
Everything is unpredictable. 
Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible? 
There might be a chance we could fix everything. 
Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. 
I wanna see everything. 
with skeletons on the end of them and everything. 
everything's gonna be all right. 
for everything... 
You took everything from me. 
Everything is gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. 

unpredictable
Everything is unpredictable. 

anybody
Is that anybody's sandwich? 
Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy? We're on the lower level. It's flooding! 
We are drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday! 

starving
I'm starving. 

talking
What are you talking about? 
Are you talking about a time machine? 
All right? It means no talking to our past selves... 
And, you know, just so we're talking about the same thing... 
I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. 
but I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about. 
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now? 
You're small, but you're talking loud. 
What are you talking about? 
How vague?
What are you talking about?
And we're talking about space magic. 

saying
what I'm saying is... 
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't. 
About what we were saying. 
so someone's gonna need to amend that and stop saying that. 
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying, jurisdiction... 

works
time works differently in the quantum realm. 
That's not how quantum physics works. 
Bingo.
That's not how it works.
Okay, so the how works. 

problem
The only problem is right now we don't have a way to navigate it. 
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved. 
Come in, we have a problem. 
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem. 
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. 

navigate
The only problem is right now we don't have a way to navigate it. 
and we could navigate it? 

thinking
I can't stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos... 
But I can't stop thinking about it. There's got to be... 
There you go. You thinking about lunch? 

somehow
I can't stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos... 

control
I can't stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos... 

chaos
I can't stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos... 

enter
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time... 

certain
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time... 

exit
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time? 

wait
Like before Thanos.
Wait.
Wait! Help me! 
Don't worry about that.
Wait a second. Let me ask you something.
Well, that's what I heard.
Wait, but who? Who told you that?
Wait, he lived in New York? 
we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up... 
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now? 
We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up... 
Two...
No, wait!
Wait. 
Thor. Just wait. 
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay? 
Wait! I'm here! 
Wait. 

machine
Are you talking about a time machine? 
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. 
Yeah. Like a time machine. 
Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.
Hot Tub Time Machine.
Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. 
Stark, is it your chest machine? 
That wasn't our only time machine. 

crazy
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy. 
It's crazy.
Scott.
so nothing sounds crazy anymore. 
I know, it's crazy. 
3,000. That's crazy. 
You're crazy! 
Dude, that was so crazy. 

emails
I get emails from a raccoon... 

raccoon
I get emails from a raccoon... 
I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain. 
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know? 

sounds
so nothing sounds crazy anymore. 
No. We know what it sounds like. 
Sounds like a deal. 
Sounds fair.

so nothing sounds crazy anymore. 
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so...

Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.

Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch? 
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. 
that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in. 

stark
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch? 
Hand over the case, Stark. 
Stark?
Stark?
Stark, is it your chest machine? 
Come on, Stark, stay with us. 
Well, I'm Howard Stark. 
Mr. Stark? 
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me? 
We won, Mr. Stark. 
We won, Mr. Stark. 

lunch
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch? 
Define "lunch" or be disintegrated.
Okay.

If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch. 
Bit of lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are...? 

define
Define "lunch" or be disintegrated.
Okay.

It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her. 
Bruce.
Listen to your mom.

Garage.
Really?
You like going in the garage, huh? 
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. 

looking
Were you looking for it?
No.
But then, I start looking at him as the cure. 
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange. 
and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone... 
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones. 
Who else is looking for these stones? 
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones. 
What am I looking at? 
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him? 
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.
